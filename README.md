- Cocktail app that emails you a recipe.
- Created with Ruby on Rails.
- Hosted on Heroku.

Simple explanation of the app:

1. User fills in a form with favorite cocktail name and email
2. The cocktail application requests the cocktail recipe with the https://www.thecocktaildb.com API (using the 'rest-client' gem).
3. The rails application sends the recipe via the gmail smtp server.
